<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey there! I'm Developer Mohamed — a full-stack developer who’s passionate about building powerful web apps, sleek mobile applications, and rock-solid system architectures. I love turning ideas into clean, scalable code that actually solves real-world problems.</p>

<p>I'm fluent in JavaScript, Python, React, Node.js, and Django — and always exploring new tools that push my limits. Whether I’m designing a user-friendly interface or building a secure backend, I focus on performance, reliability, and great user experience.</p>

<p>Coding isn’t just my job — it’s my craft. I enjoy sharing knowledge, learning something new every day, and collaborating with others who are just as passionate about tech as I am. If you're looking for someone who codes with purpose and builds with precision, you're in the right place.</p>
